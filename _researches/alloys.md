Nb-Si based in-situ composites, which have been extensively studied in the past decade, are still attracting much interest due to their possible applications as the next generation superalloys. Numerous efforts have been made to achieve the best compromise between room temperature toughness and high temperature strength by microstructure control during material preparation. A prominent eutectic solidification from melt to Nb and Nb3Si phases and a later eutectoid decomposition of Nb3Si to Nb and Nb5Si3 at lower temperature can be observed in the Nb-Si system. It has been argued that these two invariant reactions have great significance on microstructure control, in particular, the stability of Nb3Si phase strongly affects the final microstructure of the material.



A systematic ab-initio study of the energetic influences of various dopants on Nb3Si eutectoid decomposition is of particular importance, since it not only provides a deep insight into the current experimental observations, but also sheds light on the microstructure control and design of Nb-Si superalloy.



We have calculated the heats of formation of Nb, Nb5Si3 and Nb3Si phases with different dopants using ab-initio methods. By careful comparison of our theoretical results with experimental observations, we rationalize the site preferences of these dopants in Nb5Si3 and Nb3Si intermetallic compounds, and their phase partitionings between the ground state Nb and Nb5Si3 phases in Nb-Si alloy. We predict the influences of these dopants on the eutectoid decomposition of Nb3Si.
