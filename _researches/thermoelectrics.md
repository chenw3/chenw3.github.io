PbTe has garnered significant interest as a thermoelectric material. It was found that the undistorted ground state structure of PbTe transforms to a paraelectric phase at elevated temperatures, which contradicts the conventional picture of ferroelectric-paraelectric transformation. In addition, the phonon dispersions in PbTe were recently measured using INS at different temperatures. It was found that the phonon scattering in PbTe is strongly anharmonic and displays anomalous behavior at elevated temperatures, i.e. the 'waterfall' effect of the transverse optical (TO) phonon mode at Γ point and the avoided-crossing behavior between the longitude acoustic and TO branches in the Γ→X direction. More importantly, a new spectral feature emerges at the zone center at finite temperature, which is a clear signature of strong interactions and requires a theoretical explanation.



We have performed molecular dynamic simulations using a Taylor expansion interactomic potential obtained from first-principles calculations. The temperature dependent phonon spectra is computed and compared to experimental measurements, yielding insight on the origin of the observed anomalies.
