Experimental determination of the crystal structures of materials becomes difficult under extremely high pressure. Fortunately, recent developments in the methods for theoretical predictions of crystal structures provide an effective way in search of novel high-pressure phases. A number of successful applications of these methods which include the ab initio random structure searching and evolutionary approaches have been reported recently. The successful applications of the structure searching approaches show their capabilities of predicting complex configurations given only the compositions of the system.



A large number of elements and compounds undergo superconducting transitions under pressure, in particular, the critical temperatures Tc may increase with hydrostatic pressures. Therefore, the predictions of the crystal structures of high-pressure phases become invaluable in searching for high Tc superconductors.
